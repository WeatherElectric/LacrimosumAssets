# Lacrimosum Assets
The assets for [Lacrimosum](https://github.com/WeatherElectric/Lacrimosum).

# Usage
1. Create a new Unity 2022.3.9 HDRP project.
2. Run the [LC Project Patcher](https://github.com/nomnomab/lc-project-patcher#readme) (I'm not including the assets of mine because it'd be way too big, and I don't want to upload every single lethal company asset ever.)
3. Create a folder called "Lacrimosum" in the base assets folder of the project
4. Import the contents of this repository into that folder
5. Project set up, build bundles and use the [code mod repository](https://github.com/WeatherElectric/Lacrimosum) to contribute
